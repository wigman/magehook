MageHook Hook
====================
MageHook is an abstraction layer to create and dispatch custom webhooks for Magento 2.

This module does not possess any webhook events by default and won't get any in the future. Event extensions can be build upon this module or support me by buying extensions from my [extensions store](https://store.magehook.com/).

Start or expand your event driven approach. Give it a try and let me know what you think!
